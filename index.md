## Hybridising standard reduced-order modelling methods with interpretable sparse neural networks

This work proposes hybridising classical model-order reduction methods with machine learning capabilities to provide real-time solutions to mechanics problem. 

Analogous to techniques like the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) or the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), the parametric mechanical field is represented through a tensor decomposition, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality associated with numerous parameters. Each mode of the tensor decomposition is given by the output of a sparse neural network within the HiDeNN framework, constraining the weights and biases to emulate classical shape functions used in the Finite Element Method.
